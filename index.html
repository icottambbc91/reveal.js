					<h1>Tools Framework</h1>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Hey, haven't I heard of this before?</h2>
					<p>Yes you have, it was developed as a BETA before christmas by Rob Gamm and James Robertson (CPS).</p>
					<p>It's in use on TIPO and VIVO</p>
					<p>It's being used on isite now, to launch castaway as an activity</p>
					<p><a target="_blank" href="https://production.int.bbc.co.uk/isite2-xforms/fr/ian-test/picker/edit/15608c34-0bbb-4f5c-a628-1d3ffc96234e">Here's a snazy demo</a></p>
				</section>
				<!-- talk about in the demo:
					- TF bar to restrict user actions
					- Close warning, make the sure the user doesn't accidently close too soon
					- Complete callback - Activity is marked as completed when the pid is generated and so a complete notification appears.
					- We say yes, and then the pid is passed from the host to the client.
				-->
				<!-- Need to iron out what exactly is doing what i.e. What does Client need to do. What does Host need to do. --> 
				<section>
					What's changed? Why are we talking about it again.
					<p>New features:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Close callback - implemented on the HOST</li>
						<li>Sidedrawer is shipping with Tools Framework as a UI component - it uses int gel matter</li>
						<!-- list other improvements -->
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					When will it be used in the future?
					<p>Search as an activity</p>
					<!-- could i get blaises ux stuff? -->
				</section>
				<section>
					Taster for future presentations... What was this int gel matter thing you mentioned? Well it's a compoenent library...
